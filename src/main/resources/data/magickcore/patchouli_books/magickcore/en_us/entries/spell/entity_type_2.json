      "text": "If you have already digested the previous knowledge, I will now introduce you to the three main categories of spell forms: the most basic projectile type, the radiation type for releasing range spells, and the point-type form that works stably and continuously."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "title": "Projectile spell forms",
      "text": "Projectile spell forms are highly efficient at transferring mana because only projectile spells can freely move around the world. This means that projectile spell forms can carry post spells to other locations and release them when they touch blocks or entities, which are treated as targets for the post spell. The range attribute of a spell slightly increases the size of the projectile spell."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Projectile spell forms usually have a high force magic effect, which can well preserve the force value that functional spells should have, which is its advantage. If the projectile form is constructed using the \"Target is Caster\" attribute provided by the inferior diamond, then it will become an elemental spirit that follows the caster and shoot itself at surrounding creatures based on its force and range attributes."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "In addition, when a projectile spell form touches a target, it applies a \"touch type\" mana flow to the target, which brings additional benefits. In addition to projectile spells, a spirit sword also applies a \"touch type\" mana flow when it touches an entity."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "title": "Radiation spell forms",
      "text": "Radiation spell forms are a stationary area of effect form that rely heavily on the range attribute. They can apply spells to a wide range of blocks and entities, but they disappear immediately after triggering and only affect blocks for a brief moment when they are generated. Afterwards, they only check for entities within range. Most importantly, the force of mana benefits from radiation forms is only half that of regular forms or less, which makes it difficult for radiation forms to effectively transmit spells with high mana intensity."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "title": "Point-type spell forms",
      "text": "Point-type spell forms are stationary, but generally persist for a longer time than other forms. They have special trigger effects and operating methods, and cannot affect blocks. Some point-type forms do not collide, but rather serve as catalysts for previous and post spell forms. $(br2)Generally, the force, duration, and range benefits of point-type forms are only one-fifth of those of regular forms, so point-type forms are best used on targets with low movement frequency and slow movement speed, where the inability to move and lower mana benefits can be offset by a long duration of spell release."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "title": "Form collocation",
      "text": "Each of the three types of spell forms has its own characteristics, and we can use these characteristics to combine and leverage their respective strengths. For point-shaped and radiation-shaped forms, we can add a projectile form in front of them to use the projectile form to move ourselves to other positions. For the projectile form, we can also add a radiation form in front of it to release the projectile object to each entity within the radiation range."

      "text": "The essence of spell forms is to generate entities using mana and carry the mana needed for post spells to be transmitted in the world. In other words, the mana required by the caster has already been transmitted to the spell form, and triggering the post spell does not consume additional mana. In addition, there are spell forms in this world that can extract the forms of other creatures or projectiles in the world and use them as spell forms, but these spell forms cannot pass on post spells."
