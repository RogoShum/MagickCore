If the second mana arrow also touches the target, it will then pass on the attack apply type of the post spell."

It is only after this that the attack spell can be passed on, wasting the mana needed to generate the first mana arrow. $(br2)In this case, we could try to fix the problem by reversing the order of the attack type and the mana arrow form in the initial spell, so that the attack type is followed by the mana arrow form and the second attack type. This way, it should be possible to use the spirit bow."

In this world, there are three different types of spell forms: radiation, projectile, and point-type."
