During the process of exploring the world, we will gradually collect other materials such as $(#20B2AA)rotten flesh, bones, spider eyes, gunpowder, glowstone dust, redstone dust, blaze rods, nether warts$(), and so on. All these materials can be transformed and used as raw materials for crafting $(#0000FF)functional$() spells."

However, without obtaining these materials, we cannot determine their specific effects. Once we collect them, we can learn how to use them through a manual or guide."

They help us shape the $(#DA70D6)form$() of magick in the world, just like the mana arrows generated by the Spirit Bow. These arrows carry magic in the form of projectiles and release $(#0000FF)functional$() effects. $(br2)Magic is not limited to the $(#DA70D6)form$() of arrows; it can also take the form of projectiles or area radiation."

Before studying spell $(#DA70D6)forms$(), it is advisable to gather as many materials for $(#0000FF)$(#0000FF)functional$() spells$() as possible. Try different combinations of elements and states."
