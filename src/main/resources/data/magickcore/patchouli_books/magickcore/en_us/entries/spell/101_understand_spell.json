In the composition of spells, the $(#0000FF)functionality$() of a spell is closely related to these elemental attributes. $(br2)This is why obtaining elemental energy is the beginning of learning magick."

The $(#0000FF)functionality$() refers to what the mana ultimately accomplishes after taking shape, whether it's excavation, ripening, or refinement. $(br2)On the other hand, the $(#DA70D6)form$() signifies how the mana is released, be it through touch, projectiles, an area of effect, or an object that triggers the $(#0000FF)functionality$() of the spell upon contact. $(br2)A Molding Spell requires the combination of both elements to unleash its efficacy."

A fundamental $(#0000FF)functional spell$() consists of an element and an $(#0000FF)application type$() which together constitute the $(#0000FF)functionality$() of the spell. $(br2)If you have already come across some staffs in your loot chests, perhaps you already know that combining the $(#EE3B3B)[flame]$() element with the $(#0000FF)[diffusion]$() $(#0000FF)application type$() forms the $(#EE3B3B)[explosive]$() spell, while the $(#9400D3)[void]$() element combined with the $(#0000FF)[agglomerate]$() $(#0000FF)application type$() forms the $(#9400D3)[digging]$() spell."

Elements possess a tendency towards $(#0000FF)functionality$(), but the elements alone cannot realize $(#0000FF)functionality$(). Therefore, we also require $(#0000FF)[application types$()] to alter the state of the elements, enabling them to truly possess $(#0000FF)functional$() characteristics."

For instance, the $(#DA70D6)projectile form$() allows us to store mana within a magick projectile, hurl it towards a block or a creature, and upon contact, release its $(#0000FF)functionality$()."

      "text": "However, the efficiency of individual $(#DA70D6)projectile form$() for magical transmission is still insufficient. We can combine the $(#DA70D6)projectile form$() with the $(#DA70D6)area form$() to throw the projectile, and then generate an $(#DA70D6)area form$() at the impact point. This allows the $(#0000FF)functional spell$() to be transmitted to targets within the range, creating a casting effect on multiple targets at once. $(br2)In subsequent chapters, we will learn in detail how $(#DA70D6)spell forms$() are interconnected."
