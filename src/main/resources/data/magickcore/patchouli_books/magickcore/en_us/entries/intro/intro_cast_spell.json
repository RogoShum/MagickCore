If the element of the spell is not specified(Origin Element), then the element of the spell will be transformed into an element that matches itself by the spirit product or the caster. $(br2)When casting spells, the mana stored in the spirit product will be used first, and when the mana in the spirit product is insufficient, the caster's own mana will be used. Magick context can also be named through the anvil, and the name of the magick context will be displayed when the spirit product is equipped with the spell."

All life has a mana value limit of 5000. $(br2)It is worth noting that players will lose a small amount of mana upon death, so try to avoid death as much as possible. $(br2)The specific value of the mana value can be seen in the lower right corner of the Debug interface when F3 is turned on, and the value above the mana value is the elemental shield value."
