Continuous red-stone signals will keep the artificial life activated, with stronger signals causing it to cast spells slower and weaker signals causing it to cast spells faster. Artificial life does not regenerate its own mana energy and still has a mana limit of 5000, but it can absorb mana from Mana Capacity in the surrounding area."
