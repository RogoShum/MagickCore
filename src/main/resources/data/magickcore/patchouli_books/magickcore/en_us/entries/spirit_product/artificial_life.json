Continuous red-stone signals will keep the artificial life activated, with stronger signals causing it to cast spells slower and weaker signals causing it to cast spells faster. $(br2)Artificial life does not regenerate its own mana energy and still has a mana limit of 5000, but it can absorb mana from Mana Capacity in the surrounding area."
