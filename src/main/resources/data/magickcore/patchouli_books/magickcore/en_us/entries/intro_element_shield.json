Only the attack from same element can achieve the maximum benefit of damaging the Elemental Shield. $(br2)Players can produce Elemental Shields in a short period of time by drinking Shield Capacity potion. $(br2)Melee weapons wrapped with elemental strings can also effectively damage Elemental Shields."
