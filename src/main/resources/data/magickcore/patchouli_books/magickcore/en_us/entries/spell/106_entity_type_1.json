The $(#DA70D6)$(#DA70D6)Form$() spells can generate the next $(#DA70D6)$(#DA70D6)Form$() spell based on their trigger method.

Generally, when we first cast a specific $(#DA70D6)$(#DA70D6)Form$() spell, we also unlock the corresponding $(#DA70D6)Form$() knowledge, such as the knowledge of the Radiant $(#DA70D6)Form$()."

Magical benefits affect the attributes of $(#0000FF)$(#0000FF)Function$() spells. For example, the $(#00CED1)force$() ability of the Radiant $(#DA70D6)Form$() is 0.2, which means that the force effect of the subsequent spells triggered by the Radiant $(#DA70D6)Form$() and the $(#0000FF)$(#0000FF)Function$() spells it carries will be multiplied by 0.2.
