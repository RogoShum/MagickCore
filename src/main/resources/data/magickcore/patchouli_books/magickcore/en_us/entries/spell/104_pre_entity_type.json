You may have already encountered magick that is released through touch or projectiles, but these types of magick have limited structures and cannot target multiple entities simultaneously. Therefore, we also need the Radiant type of the $(#DA70D6)Form$()Spell to help us select targets within a certain range."

The passed-on function and position can be used not only by $(#0000FF)Function$() Spells but also by $(#DA70D6)Form$() Spells. When we use the Spirit Bow to generate mana arrows, they can only damage a single target. However, when we apply the Radiant $(#DA70D6)Form$() to the Spirit Bow, it will generate the Radiant $(#DA70D6)Form$() after the mana arrow hits the target. Thus, we can utilize the Radiant $(#DA70D6)Form$() to trigger $(#0000FF)Function$() Spells on multiple targets."

For example, projectile $(#DA70D6)Form$() Spells do not require $(#EE6363)Range$(), usually only increasing the duration is enough. However, Radiant-type $(#DA70D6)Form$() Spells usually require a larger $(#EE6363)Range$() attribute to target more entities. Of course, higher $(#EE6363)Range$() also means higher mana consumption. projectile $(#DA70D6)Form$() Spells have special Needs for magical elements and can be thrown into Elemental Cores, which will be explained in subsequent chapters."
